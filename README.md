My idea for this repository is to share some very useful scripts for analyzing 3G/4G/5G networks.
# Core_Border
Core and Border is an extremely important report in mobile networks, as it identifies whether or not a cell has neighbors and the distance between them. With this report it is possible to easily create another important report called Overshooters, because if we know the distance between the src cell and its neighbor tgt, we just need to add the PRACH data to know if there is overshooting or not.
